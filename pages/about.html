      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I'm Laksh Mittal — passionate about tech, biology, and staying fit. I code during the day, hit the gym in the evening, and unwind by playing guitar or shooting creative videos.</p>
      
      <p>My journey in technology began when I was young, fascinated by how computers could solve complex problems. This curiosity led me to pursue computer science and develop a deep understanding of programming languages and algorithmic thinking.</p>
      
      <p>Alongside my technical interests, I maintain a strong commitment to physical fitness. The discipline required in the gym translates well to coding — both require patience, consistency, and continuous improvement.</p>
      
      <p>Biology has always been another passion of mine. Understanding how living organisms function at a cellular level provides fascinating insights that sometimes inspire my technical work as well.</p>
      
      <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
      <p>I believe in the power of balance — between technical skill and creative expression, between physical health and mental acuity. This holistic approach guides how I work and live.</p>
      
      <p>I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies, while making sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle that fuels my creativity and productivity.</p>
